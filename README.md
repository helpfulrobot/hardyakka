## Overview

hardyakka [See 'Hard Yakka' meaning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakka) is a HTML5 template for the SilverStripe CMS ([http://silverstripe.org](http://silverstripe.org))
It is based on a similar idea used by the Boilerplate Wordpress theme (http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/boilerplate) where I have done
all the hard yakka in setting up the SilverStripe theme, all you need to do is implement your design and you are away laughing.

Requires a [`silverstripe-installer`](http://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-installer) base project.

## To do ##

Turn this theme into a more automated installation of Boilerplate from scratch and intergrate it into a default SilverStripe installation

## Installation ##

 * Install SilverStripe
 * Drop the /hardyakka folder into the /themes folder
 * Update the /mysite/_config.php file to point to the 'hardyakka' theme
